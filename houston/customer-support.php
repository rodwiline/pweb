                                            Ordering is Easy, and you could have our service in a matter of only a few days. You can call us at <a href="tel:1-888-494-5463">1-888-4WILINE</a> or you can <a href="../houston.php">complete this form</a>.<br />
                                            If your property is On-Net, we usually can install our service within 1 to 5 business days. <span class="mt24">For Off-Net properties a building survey may be required.<br /> This is a free service and requires no obligation to contract WiLine Services. Normally, even for Off-Net buildings WiLine can deliver service within 30 days from contract signtature.</span>

As well as on-net properties we also have thousands of network certified buildings to which we can provide service.

                                            Off-Net defines a property where WiLine Business Internet isn't available yet. Some Off-Net properties may require a building survey to see if the necessary requirements are in place to receive WiLine's High Speed Data Service.

                                            Symmetrical data connections deliver the same download speeds as uploads. Traditionally, the copper or cable companies would for example deliver 20 Mbit Download &amp; 2 Mbit Upload speeds. In a symmetrical connection, you would have 20 Mbits for both Download and Upload. This is a very significant advantage for businesses using cloud solutions, VoIP Technologies or Video Conferencing Services, which covers perhaps a large number of businesses these days.

                                            The number 1 cause for loss of data connectivity has to do with client side router failure. This can usually be solved within minutes with a simple restart of the router. If this doesn't solve your connectivity problem, check the server room and ensure that all switch units have power and are plugged in. If this is the case, your best option is to call one of customer service representatives on <a href="tel:1-888-494-5463">1-888-4WILINE</a> and select option 2. We will then be able to test the circuit and dispatch a field services engineer if required.

                                            If you're using a ethernet cable connection then the answer is no. However most businesses rely to some extent on WiFi connections and in this case the answer is definitely yes. Larger distnance and physical obstacles can have a significant impact in network quality within a building. If you're experiencing poor connection speeds or call quality, more often then not is due to internal routing and signaling problems. We will be able to troubleshoot this with you at the handoff if you contact our <a href="mailto:support@wiline.com">customer support staff</a>.
